## Summary

Viene is a robotic living wall that reflects the changing seasons, set to Vivaldi's _The Four Seasons_.

## Component Parts

* 8 plastic vines
* 6 servos
* Painted canvas backing
* 60 neopixels
* Electronic components
* Adafruit feather
* Power supply


Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

### Simulating Vine Growth
We initially experimented with various pulley-based mechanical systems of retracting and lengthening our plastic vines. Between the limited range of the servos and the lack of precision of the DC motors, this proved to be too difficult for the time period. Our alternative was to simulate movement by sequentially lighting up or turning off the LEDs. Since we already had to infrastructure in place to do this, it was easy to implement vie growth in software instead of adding more hardware.
